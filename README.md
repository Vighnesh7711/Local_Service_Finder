Tutorial: Local_Service_Finder
Local_Service_Finder is a Java Swing application designed to connect users with local service providers. It features intuitive user interface forms for account management, allowing both users and service providers to sign up and log in. Service providers can submit detailed profiles of their offerings, which are then displayed in a browsable service catalog. All critical application data, including accounts and service details, is persisted and retrieved using a robust JDBC database connectivity layer.
